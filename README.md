# StreamParse_FPGA: FPGA-Accelerated Streaming Data Parser

StreamParse_FPGA is a high-performance streaming data parser designed to leverage FPGA acceleration for ultra-low latency processing of real-time data streams. This project demonstrates hardware/software co-design skills critical for cutting-edge quantitative trading systems and high-frequency trading (HFT) environments.

## What is StreamParse_FPGA?

This project implements a streaming parser that offloads data processing tasks to an FPGA, enabling highly parallel and low-latency parsing of market data streams or other high-throughput data sources.

## Why FPGA Acceleration?

FPGA acceleration is increasingly important in trading technology due to its ability to process data with minimal latency and maximum throughput. By moving parsing logic to hardware, systems can reduce processing delays and improve overall trading performance.

## Tech Stack

- FPGA programming (HDL/VHDL or Verilog) â€” specify if applicable  
- C++ for interfacing and control logic  
- High-speed data streaming protocols  
- Toolchains: (Add your specific FPGA toolchain info here, e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus)

## Features

FPGA-accelerated streaming data parsing
Real-time data processing with low latency
Modular design allowing integration with other trading infrastructure components

## Performance

Achieves significant latency reduction compared to CPU-only parsing
Supports high-throughput data streams typical in financial markets

## How to Build and Run

*Note:* This project requires FPGA hardware or a simulation environment for full functionality.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbradbury91/streamparse_fpga.git
cd streamparse_fpga
# Follow FPGA toolchain-specific build instructions
# Example (replace with your actual commands):
make
./streamparse_fpga --config config.json
